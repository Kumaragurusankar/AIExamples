If you're presenting Faiss-based architecture to your CTO, here are some potential questions they might ask. These questions cover various aspects of the system, including performance, scalability, maintainability, and trade-offs:

1. General Understanding and Rationale
Why did you choose Faiss for this project?

This question aims to assess whether you've made an informed decision about using Faiss over other alternatives like Elasticsearch, Pinecone, or other vector databases.

Can you explain how Faiss handles large-scale vector search and why it's suitable for our use case?

The CTO will want to understand how Faiss scales, especially with a large volume of vectors (e.g., 10,000+ records) and how it ensures fast search performance.

2. Performance and Scalability
How does Faiss handle performance as the dataset grows?

The CTO will want to know how Faiss performs with large numbers of vectors and how it manages both the speed of indexing and search. Is there any degradation of performance when the number of records increases significantly?

What is the indexing time for 10,000 vectors, and how does it scale for 100,000 or more?

The CTO might ask for concrete data about the indexing time to ensure that the system can handle larger datasets in a reasonable amount of time.

How do you ensure that the search performance remains fast even with a large number of vectors?

They might ask about optimizations you have in place to ensure that search performance doesn't degrade as the number of records grows.

How does Faiss scale horizontally, and can we distribute the index across multiple machines for better performance?

If you're considering scaling, they might ask about distributed Faiss (or the potential for using sharding) to improve performance at scale.

3. Data Consistency and Fault Tolerance
What happens if the service crashes? Will we lose all the data in the Faiss index?

Faiss stores the vectors in memory by default, so the CTO will want to understand how data persistence is handled (e.g., saving/loading the index from disk).

What’s your strategy for backing up the index regularly to avoid data loss?

They might ask about backup strategies for the Faiss index and how frequently you plan to save the index to disk.

4. Deployment and Maintainability
How do you plan to handle Faiss updates (e.g., adding/removing vectors, updating embeddings)?

The CTO will be concerned with how the system will evolve over time. How easy is it to add new vectors, remove old ones, or update the existing embeddings in Faiss?

What happens if the service needs to be updated or restarted? Is there downtime?

Since Faiss indexes are memory-intensive, there may be concerns about downtime during service updates or restarts. How will the system handle those situations?

5. Integration and Interoperability
How will this Faiss-based vector search service integrate with other parts of the system (e.g., database, frontend, APIs)?

They’ll want to know how Faiss fits into the broader architecture. Is the search service standalone or integrated into an existing pipeline?

Can Faiss integrate with other systems, like Elasticsearch or a relational database, if necessary?

They might ask if Faiss is the only system in the stack or if you plan to integrate it with other technologies, especially if the metadata needs to be stored and queried from another system like a relational DB.

6. Data Integrity and Metadata Handling
How do you handle metadata for each vector in Faiss?

Since Faiss only stores vectors and not their associated metadata, the CTO will want to know how you handle and store metadata, as well as how you ensure consistency between the metadata and vector data.

Can metadata be updated independently of the vector data, or does it require reindexing?

This question assesses whether metadata changes necessitate reindexing, which could affect the performance and operational cost of the system.

7. Security and Access Control
How is access to the Faiss index managed? Are there any security controls to prevent unauthorized access?

This is important for ensuring that sensitive data within the vectors and metadata is protected.

How is the Faiss index protected against corruption or tampering?

The CTO will want to know about the robustness of the system against malicious tampering or data corruption.

8. Cost and Resource Usage
What are the resource requirements for running Faiss? How memory- and CPU-intensive is it?

Faiss can be quite memory-intensive, especially with large datasets. They might want an estimate of how much RAM and CPU power will be required for this service to run at scale.

How do you plan to monitor and manage Faiss-related resource usage in production?

The CTO will want to understand your strategy for monitoring system health, especially as the vector database grows.

9. Testing and Validation
How are you testing the accuracy and quality of the search results from Faiss?

The CTO will likely want to know how you validate that Faiss is returning the most relevant results (i.e., checking precision and recall of the search).

What measures are in place to handle edge cases or unexpected input (e.g., invalid vectors or incomplete metadata)?

Testing for robustness and error handling is a critical part of deploying systems like Faiss.

10. Future-proofing and Extensibility
What happens if we need to switch to a different vector search system in the future? How easy will it be to migrate from Faiss to another system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Pinecone)?

The CTO might ask about the extensibility of your current approach. Is Faiss deeply embedded in the architecture, or is it modular enough to swap out if necessary?

How to Prepare for These Questions:
Explain your decision to use Faiss: Have a clear rationale for why you chose Faiss over alternatives, especially if the CTO has preferences for certain technologies.

Provide benchmarks and data: If possible, show performance metrics like indexing time, search latency, and resource usage to demonstrate that Faiss is a good choice for your use case.

Highlight fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms: Make sure you explain how data persistence is managed, how you handle failures, and what recovery steps are in place.

Describe scalability plans: Prepare for questions about scaling (both vertically and horizontally) and how Faiss will perform as the dataset grows.

Address security concerns: Ensure you have a clear strategy for data protection, access control, and handling sensitive data.

By being prepared for these questions, you’ll show your CTO that you’ve thought through the architecture and its trade-offs, and that you're ready to handle potential challenges in production.
